# 🛡️ Cybersecurity CTF Portfolio – Zuhair Khan

Welcome! This portfolio documents my solutions, approaches, and reflections on a series of Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges completed as part of **Intro to Cybersecurity (CSCD27F24)** at the University of Toronto.

These challenges span a wide range of cybersecurity topics:

- 🔐 Cryptography (e.g. Caesar Cipher, XOR + Base64, AES, GPG)
- 🕵️‍♂️ Packet analysis and ARP spoofing
- 💻 Reverse engineering and encoding tricks
- 🌐 Web security, TLS simulation, and attacks

Each challenge folder contains a brief write-up, sample I/O files, redacted code, and test results where appropriate.
