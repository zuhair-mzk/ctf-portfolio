# 🛡️ Cybersecurity CTF Portfolio – Zuhair Khan

Welcome! This private repository documents my solutions, approaches, and reflections on a series of Capture the Flag (CTF) challenges completed as part of my coursework in **Intro to Cybersecurity** at the University of Toronto (CSCD27F24).

These challenges span a range of topics:

- 🔐 Cryptography (e.g. Caesar Cipher, AES, GPG)
- 🕵️‍♂️ Packet analysis and ARP spoofing
- 💻 Reverse engineering & encoding tricks
- 🌐 Web security and TLS simulation

Each challenge includes a short description of the problem, my thought process, partial or redacted code, and sample outputs where appropriate.
